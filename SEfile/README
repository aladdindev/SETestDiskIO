When compiling SEfile you are free to choose the sector size (ONLY IF IT IS A POWER OF 2).
It is sufficient to add as parameter -DSEFILE_SECTOR_SIZE=$NEWSECTORSIZE where $NEWSECTORSIZE is the new sector size.
If SEFILE_SECTOR_SIZE is not changed, it will automatically choose as sector size 512 Bytes.
